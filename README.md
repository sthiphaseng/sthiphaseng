- 👋 Hi, I’m Steven Thiphaseng (Tip-Ha-Sang)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding and starting a career as a front-end software developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about JavaScript, HTML, and other Front End technologies
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I am in the beginning stages of my coding career and want to learn all I can
- 📫 How to reach me - sthiphaseng@gmail.com 

- Outside of learning coding, I am a Space Management analyst for Best Buy. I love playing and watching sports, working on cars (mainly Subarus), and occasionally gaming. All that being said, I only get to do those things if my bosses (kids) allow me to.
